# Face Detection with Name and Age 

## Overview
This project is designed to detect faces in real-time or from static images using computer vision techniques. Alongside face detection, it recognizes and displays the corresponding name and age of the detected individuals. The system is built for efficient and accurate facial analysis, leveraging machine learning and database integration.

## Technologies Used 
1. OpenCV (cv2):
   - Used for face detection and image processing.  
   - Provides tools to capture video, detect faces, and overlay information on images.  

2. SQLite Database:
   - Stores and manages user details such as names and ages.  
   - Ensures easy access and efficient data retrieval during face recognition.  

3. NumPy: 
   - Aids in numerical operations and array manipulation.  
   - Optimizes data processing tasks required for facial analysis.

## Key Features 
- Real-time face detection through webcam or preloaded images.  
- Fetches user name and age from an integrated database for recognized faces.  
- Highlights detected faces and displays corresponding details.  
- Lightweight and easily extendable for future enhancements.
